This project focused on identifying and addressing acoustical issues in a small studio space at WICN Public Radio (90.5FM) to enhance its sound environment. The methodology involved consulting with acoustics professionals, referencing key literature, building a computer model to analyze acoustic challenges, and conducting on-site acoustical tests.

The analysis revealed significant modal problems and irregularly distributed reverberation times that required attention. Based on the findings, the project recommended implementing RPG Inc.‘s Modex solutions in conjunction with the construction of a performance stage to optimize the room’s acoustics.

In 2013, upon learning of [Richard Campbell][3]’s passing, I regretted not having the opportunity to continue our conversations on audio engineering. His expertise and generosity in sharing his knowledge left a lasting impression and profoundly enriched my understanding of the field.
