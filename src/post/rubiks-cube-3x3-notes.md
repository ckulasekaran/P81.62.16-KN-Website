Personal notes on solving 3x3 cube. 

Edit: Don't do this often enough, additional notes for the third layer 

## Third Layer Surface Cross
third layer: `F R U R' U' F'`

Repeat this three time if only yellow center is valid.
Repeat this twice if yellow layer is a small L away from front side.
Repeat this once if yellow is a horizontal line left-right.

This should result in a yellow-cross on the top-surface only!

## Third Layer Surface Cross Walls
This rotates the three edges away from the front face counter-clockwise. Do until the wall edges aligns with the cross.

`R U R' U R U U R'`

## Third Layer Corner Pieces
The following rotates the corner pieces in the rear triangular surface. Rotate until the top corner pieces are aligned.

`U R U' L' U R' U' L`

## Final Step
Flip the corner pieces closest to you Front/Right (re-orient), do this and always keep the corner you want to solve F/R. rotate the top surface. Keep doing this until the cube is solved!

`R' D' R D`


My notes, third layer was an older algorithm, which now I don't really recall to follow anymore (at least not how to solve the yellow cross)\
