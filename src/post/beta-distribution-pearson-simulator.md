Occasionally, after the family falls asleep, I sneak away into the kitchen to play around with some math and tech. I recently built a [micro-application][1] to simulate a four-parameter beta distribution using the [Pearson system][2].

The [Pearson Simulator web app][1] is available for use on my server weekdays between 14:00 - 15:00 GMT. Please note that this is experimental.

## Important Notes ##
* Be mindful of combinations of moments. i.e. Kurtosis > SkewnessÂ² + 1.
* Since this is a micro-server prototype, I have limited the application to a maximum of three instances. Be patient for recomputing / refresh rates. 
* Each instance has a five minute timeout, so if you are unable to access or use the app - you will have to wait a little while until a resource is free.
