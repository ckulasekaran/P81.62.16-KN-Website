Seven years in the making and finally ready to rock! This guitar represents a journey of exploration, patience, and pride, drawing inspiration from the artistry of George Lynch and Michael Schenker. The body design, based on Gibson’s iconic ’67 Flying-V, is crafted from Alder for durability and tone. The rear-routed humbucker-single pickup configuration provides versatility, while the striking artwork, hand-drawn by my son, adds a deeply personal touch. Multiple layers of semi-gloss clear coat ensure the artwork remains protected and vibrant.

The neck is a unique feature for a Flying-V, designed with a 25.5” scale and 24 frets for extended range and playability. The Tung oil finish enhances its smooth feel, making it a joy to play.

In May, I was honored to join the teaching artists of the [Boston Music Project][1] for their 10-year anniversary celebration. They requested a surprise addition to the evening’s set list, which became the perfect motivation to complete the KN-001 in time for this special event.

The pickups are direct mounted with a DiMarzio Super Distortion F-spaced in the bridge and an old Seymour Duncan Hotrails in the neck. DiMarzio's timely support was critical - they delivered on the custom color for the Super Distortion just in time for the performance. Both pickups, with their ceramic magnets, deliver rich, dynamic tones - perfect for everything from shred to smooth leads. 

I may explore reworking the wiring in the future into a split-coil option.

The Gotoh locking tremolo and machine heads ensure stability and precision, though sourcing these components on a tight timeline was a challenge. With some ingenuity and a trusted Dremel, even the toughest hardware installations were managed with reasonable precision.

Creating the KN-001 without a dedicated workspace was a lesson in adaptability. Progress often happened during family vacations across New England, with tools in tow. Completing the guitar in time for the Boston Music Project’s event was a labor of love, culminating in an unforgettable performance: a high-energy take on Bach followed by a rendition of Michael Schenker’s Coast to Coast with the talented teaching artists.
