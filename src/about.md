# About
I spend most of my week as Head of Research at [Windham Capital Management][1]. I also spearhead innovations at [Windham Labs][2] and [Cambridge Sports Analytics][3] as their co-founder. My professional interests include computational finance, numerical methods, global asset allocation, and optimization.

I also help inner city children stay engaged with school and find success via music as a Founding Board Member and Chair of the [Boston Music Project][4], a non-profit organization and Boston Public Schools partner for creative youth development.

My private time is spent playing squash, hotrod guitars, go (baduk), chess, and being with my family. On intermissions, I try for adventures without my phone - preferably in the middle of nowhere.
